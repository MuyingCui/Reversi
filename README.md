This is an android game.
The game rules are as following:
  Played with 2 players: black & white discs represent different players;
  Put 2 black and 2 white discs in the board's four center squares, with corresponding color diagonal to each other;
  Choose a color for each player, black goes first;
  Place a black disc adjacent to a white disc so that a black disc is on either side of the white disc. When a white disc is
    surrounded, the black disc player flips the white disc to black disc.
  Move on to the next player. The white player places a disc in a square adjacent to a black disc so that there are white discs
    on the either side of the black disc. Flip the black one to white.
  A player can flip any number of opposing discs so long as they have a disc on either side of consecutive opposing discs.
  If you cannot place a disc on the board, you lose your turn.
  Continuing play until every space on the board is occupied or no one can make another move. The player who has the most discs 
    on the board wins.
